# Warum nach Australien?
**Sum-up:** Many people ask me: "Why Australia? This is so far away!" Get to know my reasons to travel around half the world and what I got to learn in the recent weeks!

Everyone enjoys to be around a good leader! A good leader inspires with charism, takes difficult but wise decisions, and is easygoing and fun. I got to meet some of these, and one already as a teenage boy.

Back in 2015 me and friends of our church went to the Christian conference "BUJU" at Erfurt. The band [planetshakers gave a concert](https://www.teensmag.net/planetshakers-im-outback-mit-gott/) and I really enjoied their music. Beeing late for signing my CD, a friend and I followed the band which was just heading for the backstage area. Their fantastic [bassist](https://fbass.com/artists/josh-ham/) noticed us, turned around and came to greet us. I felt very honoured, an insignificant boy minded by a musician who tours the world! I might not have been a difficult decision, but it showed the values that this leader had. For me this was the very start to follow their new song releases, and later I started to watch their [video podcasts about sound recording and production](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYGgO0fu0xw&list=PL0kqYcuVaf64VyDhAnJzpOIB2bJn9UqVh). I really like to make music, and pairing this with getting tech knowledge sparked my interest. Ever since I thought, "Maybe one day I could attend their yearly conference in Australia?!" This idea was like a bee in my bonnet. But I got more reasons to come to Australie than to visit a conference.

Having grown up, I myself got some opportunities to "lead": at weekly class councils, at yearly kids and youth camps, by organising weekly young adults meetings at church, and at other occasions. I always liked to ask myself: "Am I doing a good job?", and "What should I maybe do differently?". I believe learning from examples and first hand experience is most effective. Best in combination with intellectual insights. So where could I find this? How could I become a better leader â€“ not for myself â€“ but to lead other people better for their sake? I knew that I'd like to spend some time after my graduation for investing in my leadership skills. But at the same time, I thought that intentionally spending a year with God would be great too, before the "40-years-of-work" begin ðŸ˜‚. Fast forward, what came out of my considerations and encouragement by others (and God's leading) was:

I'd like to...
* attend [planetshakers](https://www.planetshakers.com/) church, participate as a volunteer and get first hand experience of good leadership (another inspiring podcast is their [youth leadership podcast](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLx45UQb_qYPG-orL6HCpHsygjJIeWMK-z)).
* further develop my english skills.
* find and try out jobs that suit my education as a mathematician: (mathematical) consulting, programming, engineering.
* experience what it means to relocate to a different country ("might working as a missionary suit me?").
* challenge myself by letting go my "german need for security".
* The world is open to me (and no insurrances and houses hold me back), so why not?!
* Above all these reasons, my desire is that people fully experience the overflowing live that we can have in Jesus. And I ask myself, how can I contribute to this?

My leading objective for this year is â€“ besides clarity about future steps of employment â€“ to learn how I can become a better leader. Whose life points to God.

## The Lack of Good Leaders
Being a good leader is obviously not about talking talks, but about actually doing "the right things". The German oath of office goes like [this](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amtseid#Bundesrepublik_Deutschland): â€žIch schwÃ¶re, dass ich meine Kraft dem Wohle des deutschen Volkes widmen, seinen Nutzen mehren, Schaden von ihm wenden, das Grundgesetz und die Gesetze des Bundes wahren und verteidigen, meine Pflichten gewissenhaft erfÃ¼llen und Gerechtigkeit gegen jedermann Ã¼ben werde. So wahr mir Gott helfe.â€œ (en: "I swear that I will dedicate my strength to the welfare of the German people, increase its benefit, avert harm from it, uphold and defend the Constitution and the laws of the Federation, fulfil my duties conscientiously and do justice to everyone. So help me God.")
According to this, all our ministers (present and past) are absolutely trustworthy and exemplary leaders, right? Unfortunately not, we would all like to have politicians who have more wisdom, have backbone, and stand out with innovative and practicable ideas and approachability.

Big words: Wisdom. "So help me God"?
Read it again: What is wisdom? What does it mean to act wisely in todays world? And why would people ask God to help them?

Todays world needs wise leaders. And one "goal of a good leader should be to bring people together, not to divide them." (quote from a lecturer at Bible school) This is what our polarized society needs right now more than many other things. A recent example with potential to divide western society and Christians (after all still a huge community with [2.38 billion people](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/most-christian-countries)) was the opening ceremony of the Olympic games (find a sober comment on the background and a [sharp analysis by Johannes Hartl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GU3ECj57omw). Many Christians felt mocked by a depiction of "The Last Supper", so in fact the show did not send a "message of love, a message of inclusion and not at all to divide", as the [creative director assured](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/paris-olympics-organizers-apologize-last-supper-tableau-religious-conservatives/). How then can leaders serve to bring people together? Why might this also be important for Non-leaders? To be continued...
